1. Check Cache: The browser looks in its storage to see if it already has the webpage you want.
2. Find Server: If not, the browser asks the internet where to find the webpage's server using a DNS lookup.
3. Request Page: The browser then asks the server for the webpage using HTTP.
4. Server Responds: The server sends back the webpage's files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
5. Render Page: The browser puts together and shows you the webpage using these files.
6. Fetch Extras: If needed, the browser asks for more things like images or videos.
7. Run Code: If there's JavaScript, the browser follows its instructions, which might involve more requests.
8. So, when you type a URL and hit enter, your browser goes through these steps to show you the webpage.
