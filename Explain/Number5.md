In JavaScript, there's a default mode called "non-strict mode." It's more lenient, allowing some not-so-good practices that can lead to problems. But, there are situations when we might use it:

1. Old Code: If you're dealing with old code that doesn't work well with strict mode, you might use non-strict mode to run it without issues.
2. Easier Debugging: When fixing errors in a complicated program, non-strict mode can make it simpler to find and solve problems.
3. Library Compatibility: If you're using external tools that don't get along with strict mode, non-strict mode might be necessary to use those tools.
4. Step-by-Step Changes: If you're planning to switch to strict mode but need to do it gradually, you might use non-strict mode in some parts first.
