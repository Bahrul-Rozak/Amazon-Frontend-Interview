Situation: At my old job, my boss wanted to add a new website feature I thought was unnecessary.

Obstacles: It needed a lot of resources but wouldn't help users much.

Actions: I talked to my boss, shared my concerns, and suggested better ideas. Backed it up with data and offered to find a solution together.

Result: Boss liked my input. We went with a different, more useful and cost-friendly feature. Learned it's good to speak up and collaborate for the best solution.
